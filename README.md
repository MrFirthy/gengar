A custom theme for the blogging platform 'Ghost'
------------------------------------------------


Please Note:
------------

- This is a development in progress. The hope is to continue to leverage Ghost's new features as and when they arrive to keep improving the theme.
- For those unaware, the front-end for Ghost themes are created in Handlebars...and so this is too!
- All custom image assets are held in the 'content-img' folder. Upon installation, you should move these to your 'content/images' directory just for safety when upgrading.


Future Plans:
-------------

- Integrate LESS rather than standard CSS.
- Make it fully responsive (in progress).
- Ensure back-compatability to IE8.
